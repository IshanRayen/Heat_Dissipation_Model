# Heat Dissipation Model

This project explores the dissipation of heat through an object using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to numerically solve the Heat Equation. The process involves discretizing the equation into my time step (k) and spatial (i,j) steps, iteratively updating temperature values across a grid. Two scenarios are modeled: one with the grid center at 100°C and another with boundaries at 100°C. Iterative calculations generate updated arrays representing heat distribution over time, visualized through animation or simulation.
